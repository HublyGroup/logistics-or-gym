      # Now install _your_ project. This isn't necessary for many types of projects -- particularly
      # things like Django apps don't need this. But it's a good idea since it fully-exercises the
      # pyproject.toml and makes that if you add things like console-scripts at some point that
      # they'll be installed and working.
      - run: poetry install --no-interaction
      
      - run: poetry shell

      # And finally run tests. I'm using pytest and all my pytest config is in my `pyproject.toml`
      # so this line is super-simple. But it could be as complex as you need.
      - run: pytest
